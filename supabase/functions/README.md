# Supabase Edge Functions

## `extract-recipe`

The iOS app calls `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/extract-recipe` instead of calling Anthropic directly. This keeps private AI provider credentials out of the app binary.

### Required Supabase secrets

```sh
supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<rotated-production-key>
# Optional override; defaults to claude-sonnet-4-6
supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
```

### Deploy

```sh
supabase functions deploy extract-recipe
```

After deployment, revoke/rotate any Anthropic key that was previously committed or shipped in a client binary.
